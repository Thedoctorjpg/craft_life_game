# Craft Life 🌿

**Craft Life** is a top-down survival adventure built for the Playdate handheld. Inspired by Nadia Lim’s **"Nude Food"** philosophy, the game focuses on eating fresh, minimally processed food from the land, sea, and sky of Aotearoa.

## 🍲 The Philosophy
In Craft Life, you don't just "power up." You interact with a natural ecosystem:
* **Land:** Harvest potatoes and wheat from the soil.
* **Sea:** Use your crafted fishing rod to catch fresh snapper.
* **Sky:** Feed your pet and defend against Cave Bombers.
* **Nature:** Minimal processing—combine raw wood, stone, and iron to protect your home.

## 🚀 Features
* **Contextual Interaction:** One-button (A) controls for fishing, chopping, harvesting, and building.
* **Crafting Kitchen:** A custom menu to turn raw ingredients into tools like the **Stone Axe** or the **Iron Shield**.
* **Ecosystem AI:** Friendly horses to feed, pets to protect, and explosive Cave Bombers to avoid.
* **Particle System:** Visual "burst" effects for explosions, harvesting, and feeding.
* **Transformation:** Use Dragon Essence to take to the skies and breathe fire.
